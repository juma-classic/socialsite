# 🚨 OAuth Issues Fixed & Environment Setup Guide

## Issues Identified & Fixed:

### ✅ **1. Environment Variables Not Set**
**Problem:** "client_id is invalid 'undefined'" errors for LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook
**Solution:** Environment variables need to be set in Netlify

### ✅ **2. Twitter/X Popup Not Closing**
